Handling exception ->

1. You handle it yourself
       try / catch
       try -> put the piece of code that may throw an exception inside try
       *WITH TRY, either catch or finally is mandatory.
       Ideally -> always keep try and catch together
       1 try block, can have multiple catch blocks -> remember to go top->down, from parent to child
2. You dont handle, let the caller method handle it
        throws
        Basically the method informs that it may throw an exception


3. FINALLY
    block of code that comes either after try or catch
    this block of code always executes itself, no matter exception happened or not, handled or not
